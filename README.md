# MKS-Sbase Schematic

Long story short, I acquired a used printer that came with an MKS-Sbase controller. After spending about an hour online reading about that board and getting annoyed by MKS's "special" view on Open Source and what that entails.

So I went and found the pdf schematic on MKSs' github and replicated it in Kicad, using the opportunity to finally learn it.

Currently only the schematic has been drawn up and components annotated. It's released under the same license as the original smoothieboard.

Hopefully people in the community will take interest and correct any mistakes I made, and/or use this as a base for their own LPC1769 based printer controller.
