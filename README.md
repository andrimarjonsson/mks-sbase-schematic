# MKS-Sbase Schematic

Long story short, I aquired a used printer that came with an MKS-Sbase controller. After spending about an hour online reading about that board and got annoyed by MKS's "special" view on Open Source and what that entails.

After finding the schematic for the Sbase in pdf format I decided to have a go at redrawing it using KiCad, figured it would be a great excercise in learning it and at the same time give something back to the community.

Here you can find the results of that initial effort, released under the same licence as the original smoothieboard.

Currently only the schematic has been drawn up and components annotated, but it's a start. Hopefully people in the community will take interest and correct any mistakes I made, and/or use this as a base for their own LPC1769 based printer controller.
